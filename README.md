Beautiful-Tree is a lightweight & flexible library to draw trees as SVG images.

Some of its hightlights:
- It is compatible with ESM, CJS, UMD and IIFE
- Very lightweight (3.9Kb in its minimised ESM form, and 4.2Kb in its UMD form)
- The generated trees can be styled with CSS

For now there is only a React variant, but we'll extend the support for other
technologies such as Vue.
